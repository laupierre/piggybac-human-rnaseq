# PiggyBac human RNA-Seq (201110_A00558_0095_BHVNWGDMXX)  

This is the analysis of the in-vitro hES experiment (over-expression (oe) experiment).  
The raw counts were obtained with the IIT RNA-Seq human pipeline (see github RNA-Seq_human repository) and processed with a paired limma test (see deg_oe_unfiltered_limma.R).  
The hES shRNA experiment is also analyzed here, although not working (ie PGBD5 was not down-regulated by the shRNA).
